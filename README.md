🚀 Project Showcase: Amazon Product Price Tracker 💸

Hey everyone! 👋
Excited to share a project I recently built: a Python-based Amazon Price Tracker that monitors product prices and alerts users when there's a significant price drop. 📉

🔍 Key Features:
✅ Real-time scraping using requests and BeautifulSoup
✅ Tracks multiple products with customizable thresholds
✅ Sends email alerts with HTML-rich price history and savings info
✅ Automatically saves price history in JSON for future analysis
✅ Handles Amazon's dynamic content with multiple fallback selectors
✅ Smart wait intervals and CAPTCHA detection

🛠️ Tech Stack:

Python

BeautifulSoup

Requests

smtplib (Emailing)

JSON & File I/O

Fake UserAgent

Amazon Product Pages

📬 Example use case:
I set alerts for gadgets like the MacBook Air M1, PlayStation 5, and Atomic Habits – and got notified as soon as their prices dropped below my target!

🎯 Why this matters:
In an age of fluctuating online prices, this tool helps consumers make smarter purchase decisions by catching the right moment to buy.
